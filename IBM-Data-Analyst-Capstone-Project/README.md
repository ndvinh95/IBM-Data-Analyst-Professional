## About this Project
In this project, assuming myself as the Data Analyst for the IT company, I undertook the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics.

Critical requirements of analysis are identifying skills requirements for the future, top programming languages, database skills in demand, and IDEs in demand

At the end of this project, I prepared a presentation of my data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization including Human Resources and IT Head.
